==================
Test Basic Mixin Definition and Usage
==================
mixin hello
  p Hello, world!

+hello

(source_file
  (mixin_definition
    (mixin_name)
    (children
      (tag
        (tag_name)
        (inline_text)
      )
    )
  )
  (mixin_call
    (mixin_name)
  )
)

==================
Test Mixin with Parameters
==================
mixin greet(name)
  p Hello, #{name}!

+greet('Alice')
----
(source_file
  (mixin_definition
    (mixin_name)
    (mixin_parameters
      (parameter))

      )
    )
  )
  (mixin_call
    (mixin_name)
    (arguments
      (string)
    )
  )

==================
Test Mixin with Conditional Logic
==================
mixin greet(name)
  if name
    p Hello, #{name}!
  else
    p Hello, stranger!

+greet('Alice')
+greet()

          (condition)
          (children
            (tag
              (tag_name)
              (inline_text

  (mixin_call
    (mixin_name)
    (arguments
      (string)
    )
  )
  (mixin_call
    (mixin_name)
  )
)

==================
Test Mixin with Loops
==================
mixin userList(users)
  ul
    each user in users
      li= user

+userList(['Alice', 'Bob'])
----
(source_file
  (mixin_definition
    (mixin_name)

      (tag
        (tag_name)
        (children
          (loop
            (each_statement
              (loop_variable)
              (loop_source))
            (children
              (tag
                (tag_name)
                (expression))))))))
  (mixin_call
    (mixin_name)
    (arguments
      (array
        (string)
        (string)
      )
    )
  )
)

==================
Test Mixin with Block Content
==================
mixin card(title)
  div.card
    h3.card-title #{title}
    block

+card('My Title')
  p This is some content inside the card.
